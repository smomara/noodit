# noobit (NOOb eDITor): a simple, nooby editor
Welcome to noodit, a straightforward and minimalistic text editor built in C. This project was inspired by an ![article](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html) suggesting the creation of a text editor.

Currently, noodit is a terminal-based text editor. Plans for a GUI version are on the horizon, but for now enjoy the simplicity and effectiveness of this command-line tool.

The project is under active development and is currently only functional as a text viewer, actual editing is yet to be implemented but coming very soon.
